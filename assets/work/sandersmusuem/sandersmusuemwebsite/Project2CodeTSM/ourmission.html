	<h2> Our Mission</h2>
	<p id="paragraph1">Since the beginning of the 18th century, comics have been a predominant part of America's history. It’s as uniquely American as <b>baseball</b> or <b>apple pie.</b> No other nation on the world stage has something quite like our spandex wearing, superpowered do-gooders. Despite this, the art form has gone through much <b>adversity</b> since its inception.</p>
	<p class="paragraph2"> In 1954, German psychologist <b>Fredric Wertham</b> would release a book called <b>“Seduction of the Innocent”</b>, which defamed superheroes as <b>perverts, psychopaths,</b> and <b>iconoclasts</b> to American culture. Following this publication, A moral panic would ensue, causing numerous events where citizens would bring their sacrilegious comics into the center of town to be burned in a pit. This outrage resulted in the <b>Comics Code Authority</b>, a censorship organization that hunched over the backs of comics writers. Anything resembling the usage of drugs, the promotion of violence, or undermining family values was not allowed to be printed. Out of this age, <b>sanitized, child-centric</b> content emerged that were not allowed to do much more than entertain adolescent kids. This not only restricted the freedom of creators, but also painted comics books in a new light. <b>Complex, introspective</b> superhero works were now only suitable for the minds of <b>children.</b> The genre would not buck this identity completely until almost a century later in the mid 2010’s. </p>
	<p class="paragraph3">This is why we do what we do. We believe that the power to change the future comes with the knowledge of the past. Wertham attempted to <b>destroy</b> what so many Americans cherished, and we aim to provide <b>living proof</b> that his teachings failed. We hope to use the largest collection of issues from this <b>dark age.</b> Many of our most prestigious finds have come from members of our community. Average people who love this unseen craft, and understand its value. We are honored to work with them, and anyone else who loves comic books. We wish to make the viewing of these works <b>free, accessible,</b> and <b>available</b> to the public. </p>
