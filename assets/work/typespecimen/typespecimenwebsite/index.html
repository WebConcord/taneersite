<p>Blacker was designed in 2018 by Cosimo Lorenzo Pancini and Andrea Tartarelli and published by Zeta Fonts. Described by typographist Jeremiah Shoaf as havcing &quotevil serif&quot aesthetics, it features weighted strokes reminiscent of calligraphic strokes, triangular shaped serifs, and rigidly compact geometry. Pancini and Tartarellia cite the Bodoni family fueling them with the most inspiration for the creation of Blacker, as it is the synthesis of all of these elements.</p>

<p>Though only being public for less than a decade, it has attained wide appeal, resulting in a superfamily with other fonts such as Blacker Pro, Blacker Mono, Blacker Sans and Blackest. Some of the fonts are improved versions of the original Blacker, or were designed for niche uses such as coding or web UI, all styles still retain Blacker&#x201Bs core aesthetics. Blacker Display has even more exaggerated stroke thickness, so that the font&#x201Bs features can be displayed boldly at large point sizes. Blacker Text, on the other hand, has more subdued stroke thickness in order to maximize readability on web devices and body text.</p>
